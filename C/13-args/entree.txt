THE MAN WHO PASSES THE SENTENCE SHOULD SWING THE SWORD.

THE THINGS I DO FOR LOVE.

THE NEXT TIME YOU RAISE A HAND TO ME WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU HAVE HANDS!

IT'S THE FAMILY NAME THAT LIVES ON. IT'S ALL THAT LIVES ON.

WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME OF THRONES, YOU WIN OR YOU DIE.

I LEARNED HOW TO DIE A LONG TIME AGO.

WHEN DEAD MEN AND WORSE COME HUNTING ... YOU THINK IT MATTERS WHO SITS ON THE IRON THRONE?

TURN US AWAY, AND WE WILL BURN YOU FIRST.

A GIRL GIVES A MAN HIS OWN NAME?

YOUR JOY WILL TURN TO ASHES IN YOUR MOUTH.

A DRAGON IS NOT A SLAVE.

BURN THEM ALL

CHAOS ISN'T A PIT. CHAOS IS A LADDER.

THE LANNISTERS SEND THEIR REGARDS.

YOU KNOW NOTHING, JON SNOW.
